            A classic holiday song, today, the song of survival as Ukraine’s Shchedryk Children Choir performs “Carol Of The Bells” at New York’s Carnegie Hall . The same venue where the Ukrainian song premiered a century ago. The choir’s members reunited this summer
            after many fled to safer places during the war. Over the last few weeks, they rehearsed in Kyiv, sometimes practicing in a bomb shelter without electricity. Now, the children who’ve been through so much are proving joy and hope can prevail.
