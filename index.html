    <p class="text">Ukrainian Christmas carols, also known as "koliadky", are an integral part of Ukrainian Christmas celebrations. These beautiful and festive songs tell the story of the birth of Jesus and express the joy and hope of the holiday season.

    <p class="text"> A classic holiday song, today, the song of survival as Ukraine’s Shchedryk Children Choir performs “Carol Of The Bells” at New York’s Carnegie Hall . The same venue where the Ukrainian song premiered a century ago. The choir’s members reunited this
        summer after many fled to safer places during the war. Over the last few weeks, they rehearsed in Kyiv, sometimes practicing in a bomb shelter without electricity. Now, the children who’ve been through so much are proving joy and hope can prevail.</p>
